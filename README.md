Tic-Tac-Toe
This is a solo project build to demonstrate competency using classes and programing
in the python3 language. This will be a simple tic tac toe game using just the base
program to display a three by three board and then the user will be asked to choose
one of the numbers from the board to be replaced with either an 'X' or an 'O', which 
will represent player one and player two.
